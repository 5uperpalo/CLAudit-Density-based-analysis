# CLAudit : Density based analysis

Scripts were created during the stay at NII to show universality of an approach, previously applied to Darknet and MAWI datasets :

Application of the unsupervised machine learning approaches to network traces (MAWI, Darknet). Generalization and improvement of the hierarchical density-based clustering approach to network measurements interpretation proposed during AIT Vienna internship.

Scripts are density based clustering extension of the ideas proposed in:
